# Tarot App Deployment Guide

## Current Status ✅

The application has been successfully cleaned up and is ready for deployment:

- ✅ All console.log statements removed for production
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- ✅ Build process working correctly
- ✅ Application tested locally

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure your Supabase environment variables are properly configured:

**For Development:**
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**For Production:**
Set environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

**Note:** GitHub Pages doesn't support environment variables. For GitHub Pages deployment, consider using Vercel or Netlify instead.

### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration
The application is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:
- Base path: `/tarot/`
- Build output: `dist/`
- Homepage: `https://sethgarrison.github.io/tarot`

### 3. Image Assets
Ensure all tarot card images are in the `public/tarot-images/` directory.

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel
2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
3. **Deploy** - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Connect your repository** to Netlify
2. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard
3. **Deploy** - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app

### Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Limited)

**Note:** GitHub Pages doesn't support environment variables, so Supabase functionality won't work.

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment - cleaned up logging and fixed TypeScript errors"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy using npm script:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch
   - Save

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel or Netlify
2. **Set environment variables** in the deployment platform
3. **Deploy** - the build process is already configured

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Check the deployed site** at `https://sethgarrison.github.io/tarot`
2. **Test all features:**
   - Card Reader (drawing cards)
   - Deck page (browsing all cards)
   - Tutorial page (learning content)
   - Card flipping and interactions
3. **Verify Supabase connection** is working in production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Environment Variables Not Set**
   - Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured
   - Check that the variables are accessible in the deployment environment

2. **Images Not Loading**
   - Verify all tarot card images are in `public/tarot-images/`
   - Check that the image paths match the card names

3. **Build Failures**
   - Run `npm run build` locally to test
   - Check for any TypeScript errors
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

4. **CORS Issues**
   - Verify Supabase CORS settings include your domain
   - Check that the Supabase project is properly configured
